#Surf and Shake: An Analysis of Weather Data for Oahu, Hawaii

Overview of the Analysis


I've always loved ice cream, but recently I discovered during a vacation in Hawaii that I also enjoy surfing the waves! Is there some way to combine both and create a path back to Hawaii? Well, I believe I have come up with a fool-proof plan to combine ice cream and surfing that will take me back to Hawii forever: a surf and shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course, me! I've got savings I'm going to invest, but I'll need and investor to get my dream going. After putting together a strong business plan I've reached out to an investor, W. Avey, who is famous for his love of surfing. He is interested in my proposal, but has concerns about weather being a factor in the success of my business plan because his previous surf shop was rained out of existance. W. Avey knows of my expertise in analyzing data and has requested I analyze data he has from the the island of Oahu, the island I want to start my new business on in the future. I'll be using the data he has provided to take an analytical look at the weather conditions, especially the precipitation and temperatures of Oahu, in order to provide a solid case for my business plan. If sucessful, there is always the potential for duplicating this business plan in other locations, so preserving the analysis process is important for future growth opportunities. 

In this project I'll be analyzing precipitation levels for the past 12 months to show W. Avey that my choice of Oahu is perfect for this business venture. W. Avey doesn't just want to see a list of data; he wants to understand trends in the data. To put W. Avey at ease, I'm going to create a plot of precipitation scores in chronological order. Rather than simply showing him whether it rained on a given day, I'll show him how much it rained and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days as well. All of this information will be very hepful to W. Avey when he presents my plan at his quarterly board meeting. I'll provide solid statistical analysisâ€”such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. He needs hard results if he's going to invest his money. Finally, I'll provide W. Avey with temperature trends for the months of June and December to help him and his board see that the surf and ice cream business are sustainable year-round.
